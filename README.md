# 3d Tic-Tac-Toe
A 3d implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe in Java.

This project was a collaboration with 2 other students, Reeve Lood and Nate Hausfater. The final result is uploaded in bulk here, as the main repo is tied to the University.

My areas of contribution were the 3d graphics, board generation, gameplay logic and object design. The Shop and various controllers/fxml files were mostly done by my group members, although I did help link together the backend models with the gameplay controllers.
